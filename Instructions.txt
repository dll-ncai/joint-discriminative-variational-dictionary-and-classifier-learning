Two files of python code, one for Variational inference named as "JVDC_p.py" and the otherone for Stochastic Variational inference and named as "JSDC_p.py" have been included. 
Two datasets named as "caltechData.npz" for Caltech Dataset and "ExtendedYaleB.mat" have also been included for training our models.
Note that VI ans SVI's implementation codes have been included to present a comperitive grounds to justify the effeciency of SVI algorithm.
Detail instructions about the codes have been included in the respective files in the ending segments of the code files.
Place all the files in the same directory and run the respective codes after installing necessary python packages, as listed at the start of each file.
